## 100 Days Of Learning - Log
For 100 days I'm going to commit do listening to learning material for 2 hours each day, while doing the Stationary Bike.
### Day 5: July 3, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Listened to AWS SysOps Lectures on Route53 for an hour while doing the stationary bike.  Then started on FCC Speedrun adding local weather to my personal website.  I was able to get the latitude and longitude and also the weather using Dark Sky API.  I wanted to show the city name, however, and I had some issues.  Many I resolved like I realised I needed an API_KEY and a few other things.  It ended without the API_KEY working for some reason.  I will look again tomorrow.  I also had an idea about YFI website.  Currently the .css file isn't being used when it is deployed to AWS ElasticBeanstalk.  I had another idea of putting it in the head under <style> and seeing if this resolves the issue (although not ideal).  I have a question on the forum that no one has answered in 5 days.  

**Thoughts**: Had a good run.  I wish I had done more, but happy I did some coding.  I stopped myself from continuing on the videos and decided to start coding.

**Hours 3.0**

**Got sidetracked in here, instead of starting completely over going to keep going until I reach 100 Days even if I miss a few days in between**

### Day 4: June 14, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 5 and started Section 6 only to find that this wasn't the bootcamp.  I thought that the other day, but I couldn't find the correct one.  Anyway.  this was a good class, will definitely still come back to it.  Now doing the proper one.  Complete Java SE 8 Bootcamp (also on Udemy).  

**Thoughts**:

**Hours 2.0** Still working, will do more later


### Day 3: June 13, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 1-4 of Tim Bushka's Java Master Class on Udemy (22 Sections)

**Thoughts:** This first part is just review, listening to it on 1.5 speed.  Doing this because taking Certification on June 24th.  Want to go through this class, a OCA Study book and practice of course.  Got up early to do this, feels good to have finished before having to get going for the day.

**Hours 2.0**


### Day 2: June 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Section 6.  Udemy Course by Eduonix.

**Thoughts:** Need to learn Mongo so that I can use with my website YourFinancialIntel, because you can only make so many requests from Twitter.  Going to use database to store and then just add current ones instead of going after all each time we refresh.  Tomorrow I need to relisten to a couple lectures in Section 6 and try to do them myself with my app.

**Hours 2.0**

### Day 1: June 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Sections 1 - 5 Git Complete by Jason Taylor on Mapt

**Thoughts:** Wanting to getting a better understanding of Git so that I can start using it with all my projects and also for the Chingu Challenge.

**Hours 2.0**
