### Day 3: June 13, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 1-4 of Tim Bushka's Java Master Class on Udemy (22 Sections)

**Thoughts:** This first part is just review, listening to it on 1.5 speed.  Doing this because taking Certification on June 24th.  Want to go through this class, a OCA Study book and practice of course.  Got up early to do this, feels good to have finished before having to get going for the day.

### Day 2: June 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Section 6.  Udemy Course by Eduonix.

**Thoughts:** Need to learn Mongo so that I can use with my website YourFinancialIntel, because you can only make so many requests from Twitter.  Going to use database to store and then just add current ones instead of going after all each time we refresh.  Tomorrow I need to relisten to a couple lectures in Section 6 and try to do them myself with my app.
