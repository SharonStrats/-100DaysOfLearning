## 100 Days Of Learning - Log
For 100 days I'm going to commit do listening to learning material for 2 hours each day, while doing the Stationary Bike.

### Day 10: July 19, 2017 Wednesday
**Today's Progress:**
**Thoughts:**
**Hours**

### Day 9: July 18, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**  More Colt Steele - mostly review, but learning a few things here and there.  Good to just put it all together once again.  Also React Stephen Grider, making my way through that.  I realize coming from structured programming experience I prefer React and Angular and those types of frameworks and Javascript.  It makes more sense to me.  

**Thoughts:**

**Hours 2 **

### Day 9: July 16, 2017 Sunday
**Today's Progress:**  I did more of Colt Steele and some React.  I'm writing after the fact so I will just add it up and write what I'm up to next time.  I also finished reading chapter 2 of this and Prototype, but want to go over it one more time.

**Thoughts:**
**Hours 2 **


### Day 8: July 15, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress:**  Spent time listening to Colt Steeles Web Development course, got to Section 5.  Also, listen to the JAVA OCA cert course.  Tackled Twitch and Wikipedia from FCC.  Laid out on a Trello board what I will accomplish in the next 50 days so far.  Need to keep going with that.  Didn't complete it yet.

**Thoughts:**  Same thing..  need to look into CORS further.  I think I understand, but I'm not able to always resolve the issues.  I did get the city to work from my thoughts a few weeks ago.

**Hours 6.0**

**Did lots in between here, but just didn't log.  I worked on www.sharonstratsianis.com and even got it running.  Added the weather to it.  Took an all day workshop on CI/CD.  Used TravisCI, learned a lot.  My goal is to just keep tracking until I get to 100 days, even if I miss tracking in between.  Also, haven't been too good about stationary bike, but will start that up again tomorrow.**

### Day 7: July 5, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent at least a couple hours working on AWS SysOps certification.  Listening to videos about VPC and then beginning to read the security WhitePaper.  After that I realised I have to do some actual coding.  I worked for a couple hours and mananged to get the google geocode working and the city displaying on my screen.

**Thoughts**: Still having two issues.  I just happened to see where my city was and was able to grab it that way.  I need to search for political, locality..  and then pick those array items.  I also ran into a problem with CORS.  I still don't think I fully understand how to get around this.  I need to research further.  And still need to get quotes working.

**Hours 4.0**

### Day 6: July 4, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have as much time today because of Alexia's movie day.  Did manage to get to the FreeCodeCamp meetup finally.  It was great!  I worked on getting the weather and the quotes from Intermediate Projects.  I got closer with both.  Was able to display the weather.  Still having trouble with CORS on the quotes and also "key" issue with google for reverse geocodes.

**Thoughts:** So happy I went to the meetup.  Been trying to get there.  Almost didn't go again as well, but at the end made it happen.

**Hours 2.0**

### Day 5: July 3, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Listened to AWS SysOps Lectures on Route53 for an hour while doing the stationary bike.  Then started on FCC Speedrun adding local weather to my personal website.  I was able to get the latitude and longitude and also the weather using Dark Sky API.  I wanted to show the city name, however, and I had some issues.  Many I resolved like I realised I needed an API_KEY and a few other things.  It ended without the API_KEY working for some reason.  I will look again tomorrow.  I also had an idea about YFI website.  Currently the .css file isn't being used when it is deployed to AWS ElasticBeanstalk.  I had another idea of putting it in the head under <style> and seeing if this resolves the issue (although not ideal).  I have a question on the forum that no one has answered in 5 days.  

**Thoughts**: Had a good run.  I wish I had done more, but happy I did some coding.  I stopped myself from continuing on the videos and decided to start coding.

**Hours 3.0**

**Got sidetracked in here, instead of starting completely over going to keep going until I reach 100 Days even if I miss a few days in between**

### Day 4: June 14, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 5 and started Section 6 only to find that this wasn't the bootcamp.  I thought that the other day, but I couldn't find the correct one.  Anyway.  this was a good class, will definitely still come back to it.  Now doing the proper one.  Complete Java SE 8 Bootcamp (also on Udemy).  

**Thoughts**:

**Hours 2.0** Still working, will do more later


### Day 3: June 13, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 1-4 of Tim Bushka's Java Master Class on Udemy (22 Sections)

**Thoughts:** This first part is just review, listening to it on 1.5 speed.  Doing this because taking Certification on June 24th.  Want to go through this class, a OCA Study book and practice of course.  Got up early to do this, feels good to have finished before having to get going for the day.

**Hours 2.0**


### Day 2: June 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Section 6.  Udemy Course by Eduonix.

**Thoughts:** Need to learn Mongo so that I can use with my website YourFinancialIntel, because you can only make so many requests from Twitter.  Going to use database to store and then just add current ones instead of going after all each time we refresh.  Tomorrow I need to relisten to a couple lectures in Section 6 and try to do them myself with my app.

**Hours 2.0**

### Day 1: June 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Sections 1 - 5 Git Complete by Jason Taylor on Mapt

**Thoughts:** Wanting to getting a better understanding of Git so that I can start using it with all my projects and also for the Chingu Challenge.

**Hours 2.0**
