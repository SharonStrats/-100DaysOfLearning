## 100 Days Of Learning - Log
For 100 days I'm going to commit do listening to learning material for 2 hours each day, while doing the Stationary Bike.

### Day 2: June 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed Section 6.  Udemy Course by Eduonix.

**Thoughts:** Need to learn Mongo so that I can use with my website YourFinancialIntel, because you can only make so many requests from Twitter.  Going to use database to store and then just add current ones instead of going after all each time we refresh.  Tomorrow I need to relisten to a couple lectures in Section 6 and try to do them myself with my app.

**Hours 2.0**

### Day 1: June 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Made it through Sections 1 - 5 Git Complete by Jason Taylor on Mapt

**Thoughts:** Wanting to getting a better understanding of Git so that I can start using it with all my projects and also for the Chingu Challenge.

**Hours 2.0**
